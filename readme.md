Hello my name is Breiner Alvarez and welcome to my GitHub.
This is a practice project in order to apply all the knowledge acquired on Platzi course: Curso profesional de Git y GitHub.
Here I will be explaining some basic Git concepts so that you can learn how to use it in your projects.
There's nothing you can do about it, hahahhaha.
